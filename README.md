🤫 This code 🤖 checks whether a given number is a prime number 🔢 or not and calculates its factorial 🧮. 

The `prime()` function 🛡️ uses a for loop to iterate through all possible factors of the given number. 
If the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, then it's not a prime number and the function returns `False`. 
If the number is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, then it's a prime number and the function returns `True`. 

The `factl()` function 🤓 calculates the factorial of the given number using a for loop. 
It multiplies the number by all the positive integers below it until it reaches 1. 
The function then outputs the result.

The program 🖥️ then uses both functions to display the information about whether the given number is a prime number or not and the factorial of the given number. 
If the number is prime, it displays a message saying that the number is prime. 
If the number is not prime, it displays a message saying that the number is not prime. 
It then displays the factorial of the given number.
